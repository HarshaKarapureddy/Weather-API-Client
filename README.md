#Latest Update v2
The API now includes a GUI, making it more user-friendly, as well as catching any exception raised when the user enters a
non-existing city. Go to the updated branch for new Instructions and screenshots.

# WeatherAPI
A quick API pull that uses a city name as input to give weather data as output. 
The name can be changed within the Python Script (There will be an updated version with GUI, that would be more user-friendly).

#Instructions and Use
 1. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](openweathermap.org) to sign up for an API key.
 2. Pass the API key along with your desired location via args for example;
 ``` bash
 python3 main.py --token 179a42c0b5426f80b65709467d2e15d0 --location Rockville
 ```
